                    A paragraph (from the Greek paragraphos, “to write beside” or
                    “written beside”) is a self-contained unit of a discourse in
                    writing dealing with a particular point or idea. A paragraph
                    consists of one or more sentences. Though not required by the
                    syntax of any language, paragraphs are usually an expected part
                    of formal writing, used to organize longer prose.
